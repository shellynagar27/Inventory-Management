## üîç Key Findings

- **Stock Analysis:**
  - *Home & Garden* category has the highest stock quantity (~381K units), while *Electronics* has the lowest (~328K units).
  - 262 products currently fall below their reorder point, indicating a need for timely restocking.

- **Supplier Performance:**
  - *Supplier SUP041* has the highest average lead time (~121 days), primarily for *Books* and *Toys* categories.
  - The shortest lead time is from *Supplier SUP050* (~85 days), suggesting better restocking efficiency.

- **Restocking Patterns:**
  - Restocking spikes were observed in **Sep 2024**, **Oct 2023**, and **May 2025**, hinting at potential seasonal trends.
  - Products marked "Out of Stock" have an average of **202 days** since last restock‚Äîindicating a critical delay.

- **Cost & Turnover Analysis:**
  - Top 5 most expensive products are priced above $999, spanning categories like *Books*, *Home & Garden*, *Office Supplies*, and *Electronics*.
  - *Home & Garden* has the fastest stock turnover rate, while *Electronics* shows the slowest.

- **Warehouse & Geography:**
  - *Germany* stores the most products (~533 SKUs), with a concentration in *Sports & Toys*.
  - Country-level stock patterns vary by product category, useful for regional logistics planning.

## üí° Recommendations

- **Optimize Reordering Strategy:**  
  Focus on replenishing products below reorder points to avoid lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.

- **Review Supplier Contracts:**  
  Reevaluate suppliers with long lead times (e.g., SUP041) and consider diversifying sources to reduce restock delays.

- **Prepare for Seasonal Demand:**  
  Leverage historical restocking data to forecast inventory needs during peak months and avoid stockouts.

- **Monitor High-Cost SKUs:**  
  Track high-value inventory closely to manage pricing, reduce holding costs, and align with customer demand.

- **Improve Warehouse Efficiency:**  
  Balance stock distribution across warehouses to avoid overstocking in specific regions and optimize logistics.
